A collection of data visualizations using D3.js

### Closeness (heatmap)

This is a visualization of my perceived closeness to classmates throughout a 12-week program. It allows for sorting by demographics (such as age, gender, and race), as well as by custom parameters, such as how early on I worked with the person in the program.

### Budget (circles by size)

This renders my personal budget for three months, split by category, as the area of circles.

## Uploading screenshare demos for Mac users

Getting gifs on GitHub is a really nice way to show off what your repo can do, especially if it is not something that is deployed (or something you even want to deploy, as in the case of this repo where there is personal data I don't want to share).

Here is a step-by-step process to get something from your screen to your GitHub.

### Programs needed

* QuickTime Player
* iMovie (optional)
* [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) - it's free!

### Instructions
1. *Start a screen recording:* Open QuickTime Player and go to File -> New Screen Recording (control-âŒ˜-n). This will allow you to start recording all or part of your screen.
1. *Stop the recording:* Control-click on the QuickTime icon in your dock, and select Stop Screen Recording. To be able to use gfycat, our preferred gif uploader to preserve as much resolution as possible, limit the recording to 15 seconds (or you can go longer if you are planning on speeding up the clip later).
1. *If you wish, edit the video in iMovie for length:* The two main things you will likely want to do is clip your recording, and speed it up. Make sure the clip ends up being 15 seconds or shorter.
1. *Crop out black bars and adjust video size:* Open the file in Handbrake. Go to Picture Settings, click on Preview to open a pop-up preview, and select Cropping -> Custom. Here you can manually set the crop to remove unwanted areas of the video. Then go to Width/Height and adjust the size to be approximately 500 (the units are in pixels) on the larger dimension, or you can go smaller.
1. *Upload as a gif:* Go to [gfycat](https://gfycat.com) to upload your video (or any similar site of your choice). Once it is complete, you will need to wrangle the URL they give you, to get a raw .gif URL that can be used to show the gif on GitHub. The URL given will look something like https://gfycat.com/AdjectiveAdjectiveNoun. Try making it https://giant.gfycat.com/AdjectiveAdjectiveNoun.gif, or https://fat.gfycat.com/AdjectiveAdjectiveNoun.gif, until you find the right URL.
1. You're done! You can now include the URL in your README with the usual image syntax in Markdown: ```![alt text](url)```.
